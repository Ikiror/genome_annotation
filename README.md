# Organization and Annotation of Eularyotic Genomes
This project performs the organization and annotation of the genome of the Arabidopsis thaliana Est-0 accession. This is done by:
1. transposable element (TE) annotation and classification with tools such as EDTA, TEsorter, RepeatMasker(scripts 01-03 and 09) 
2. Annotation of genes with the MAKER pipeline with tools and libraries such as MAKER, MPI, Augustus, GeneMark, BLAST, Exonerate, GenomeThreader, Interproscan, BUSCO, AGAT (scripts 04-08, 10-15)
3. Functional annotation and genome comparisons with tools and databases such as Uniprot, BLAST, MAKER, TAIR10, GENESPACE,  (scripts 16-23)
